# Mathematical Model of Signal Filtering: First Principles Analysis


## Abstract

This report derives the complete mathematical framework for signal filtering from first principles. Four governing equations are established for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems: convolution integral, frequency response, transfer function, and differential equation representations.

**Applications:** Telecommunications, audio processing, biomedical engineering, control systems, image processing.

## 1. Fundamental Principles

### 1.1 System Definition
A filtering system transforms input signal `x(t)` to output signal `y(t)`:
```
x(t) → [FILTER] → y(t)
```

### 1.2 LTI System Properties

**Linearity:**
```
T[ax₁(t) + bx₂(t)] = aT[x₁(t)] + bT[x₂(t)]
```

**Time-Invariance:**
```
If T[x(t)] = y(t), then T[x(t - τ)] = y(t - τ)
```

**Consequence:** Any LTI system is completely characterized by its impulse response `h(t)`.

## 2. Mathematical Derivations

### 2.1 Impulse Response Foundation

**Dirac Delta Function:**
```
δ(t) = 0 for t ≠ 0,  ∫₋∞^∞ δ(t)dt = 1
```

**Sifting Property:**
```
∫₋∞^∞ f(t)δ(t - t₀)dt = f(t₀)
```

**Impulse Response:**
```
h(t) = T[δ(t)]
```

### 2.2 Convolution Integral Derivation

**Signal Decomposition:**
```
x(t) = ∫₋∞^∞ x(τ)δ(t - τ)dτ
```

**System Response (applying linearity + time-invariance):**
```
y(t) = ∫₋∞^∞ x(τ)h(t - τ)dτ
```

### 2.3 Frequency Domain Analysis

**Fourier Transform:**
```
X(jω) = ∫₋∞^∞ x(t)e^(-jωt)dt
```

**Convolution Property:**
```
y(t) = (x * h)(t) ⟺ Y(jω) = X(jω)H(jω)
```

## 3. Governing Equations

### 3.1 Four Mathematical Models

#### **1. Time-Domain Convolution**
```
y(t) = ∫₋∞^∞ h(τ)x(t - τ)dτ     [Continuous]
y[n] = ∑_{k=-∞}^∞ h[k]x[n-k]     [Discrete]
```

#### **2. Frequency Response**
```
H(jω) = ∫₋∞^∞ h(t)e^(-jωt)dt
Y(jω) = H(jω)X(jω)
```

#### **3. Transfer Function**
```
H(s) = (∑_{k=0}^M b_k s^k)/(∑_{k=0}^N a_k s^k)     [Laplace]
H(z) = (∑_{k=0}^M b_k z^{-k})/(∑_{k=0}^N a_k z^{-k}) [Z-transform]
```

#### **4. Differential Equation**
```
∑_{k=0}^N a_k (d^k y(t))/(dt^k) = ∑_{k=0}^M b_k (d^k x(t))/(dt^k)
```

### 3.2 Mathematical Relationships
```

     ↕              ↕
Differential Eq. ⟷ Transfer Function
```

## 4. Physical Constraints

### 4.1 Causality
```
h(t) = 0 for t < 0
```
**Application:** Required for real-time systems.

### 4.2 Stability (BIBO)
```
∫₋∞^∞ |h(t)|dt < ∞     [Continuous]
∑_{n=-∞}^∞ |h[n]| < ∞   [Discrete]
```
**Application:** Ensures bounded outputs for bounded inputs.
