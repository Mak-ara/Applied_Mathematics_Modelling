# Mathematical Framework for Traffic Light Optimization

This document presents a comprehensive mathematical framework for traffic light optimization systems. The mathematical models and equations are derived from first principles, encompassing traffic flow theory, queueing dynamics, and optimization methodologies.

## Executive Summary

Traffic light optimization represents a complex engineering problem requiring the application of multiple mathematical disciplines. The optimization process involves minimizing vehicular delay while maintaining system stability under capacity constraints. This framework establishes the theoretical foundation necessary for developing practical traffic control algorithms.

## Fundamental Mathematical Formulation

### Traffic Flow Conservation Laws

The mathematical description of traffic flow begins with the application of conservation principles. The continuity equation, derived from the conservation of mass, forms the foundation of macroscopic traffic flow theory:

```
∂ρ/∂t + ∂(ρv)/∂x = 0
```

**Parameters:**
- `ρ(x,t)` = traffic density [vehicles/km]
- `v(x,t)` = space-mean speed [km/h]
- `x` = spatial coordinate
- `t` = temporal coordinate

This partial differential equation establishes that the rate of change in density at any point equals the negative divergence of the flow field. The fundamental diagram provides the constitutive relationship between macroscopic traffic variables:

```
q = ρ × v
```

The Greenshields linear speed-density relationship is commonly employed:
```
v = vf(1 - ρ/ρjam)
```

Where `vf` represents free-flow speed and `ρjam` denotes jam density.

### Queue Formation Dynamics

Traffic signal control creates periodic interruptions in traffic flow, resulting in queue formation and dissipation. The dynamics of queue length evolution are governed by ordinary differential equations based on flow conservation principles.

For approach `i`, the queue length `qi(t)` evolves according to:

```
dqi(t)/dt = λi(t) - μi(t) × φi(t)
```

**State Variables:**
- `qi(t)` = instantaneous queue length [vehicles]
- `λi(t)` = arrival flow rate [vehicles/second]
- `μi(t)` = departure flow rate during green [vehicles/second]
- `φi(t)` = signal phase indicator function

**Phase-Specific Dynamics:**

During red phase (`φi(t) = 0`):
```
dqi/dt = λi(t)
```

During green phase (`φi(t) = 1`):
```
dqi/dt = λi(t) - μi(t)
```

The solution to these differential equations provides the temporal evolution of queue lengths throughout the signal cycle.

## Delay Analysis and Queueing Theory

### Webster's Analytical Solution

The seminal work by Webster established an analytical framework for computing average delay per vehicle. This formulation assumes Poisson arrivals and deterministic service times, yielding:

```
di = C(1-gi/C)²/[2(1-xi)] + xi²/[2μi(1-xi)]
```

**Control Parameters:**
- `C` = cycle length [seconds]
- `gi` = effective green time for approach i [seconds]
- `xi = (λi/μi) × (C/gi)` = degree of saturation

The first term represents uniform delay component, while the second term accounts for random delay due to stochastic arrivals.

### Integral Formulation of Total Delay

The total delay experienced by all vehicles on approach `i` during one cycle is expressed as:

```
Di = ∫₀ᶜ qi(t) dt
```

This integral represents the cumulative vehicle-time delay, with units of vehicle-seconds.

## Optimization Framework

### Single-Objective Formulation

The primary optimization objective involves minimizing total system delay across all approaches:

```
minimize: Z = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ λi × di
```

Subject to operational constraints:

**Timing Constraint:**
```
Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ gi + L = C
```

**Capacity Constraints:**
```
xi < 1 ∀i ∈ {1,2,...,n}
```

Where `L` represents lost time per cycle and `n` denotes the number of signal phases.

### Lagrangian Optimization Method

The constrained optimization problem is solved using Lagrange multiplier techniques. The Lagrangian function is formulated as:

```
L = Z + α(Σᵢ gi + L - C) + Σᵢ βi(xi - xmax)
```

First-order optimality conditions require:
```
∂L/∂gi = 0 ∀i
∂L/∂C = 0
```

These conditions yield the fundamental result that optimal green time allocation equalizes marginal delay across all approaches:
```
∂Z/∂gi = α ∀i
```

## Advanced Mathematical Techniques

### Dynamic Programming for Time-Varying Optimization

Traffic demand exhibits temporal variations requiring dynamic optimization approaches. The Bellman optimality principle provides the theoretical framework:

```
V(q,t) = min_u {c(q,u,t) + V(f(q,u,t), t+1)}
```

**Components:**
- `V(q,t)` = value function representing minimum cost-to-go
- `q` = state vector (queue lengths)
- `u` = control vector (signal timing parameters)
- `c(q,u,t)` = instantaneous cost function
- `f(q,u,t)` = state transition function

### System Stability Analysis

Traffic control systems must maintain stability under varying demand conditions. Lyapunov stability theory provides mathematical tools for stability analysis.

**Candidate Lyapunov Function:**
```
V(q) = ½ Σᵢ qi²
```

**Stability Condition:**
```
dV/dt = Σᵢ qi × dqi/dt < 0
```

Satisfaction of this condition ensures asymptotic stability of the equilibrium state.

### Stochastic Process Modeling

Vehicle arrivals exhibit random characteristics requiring stochastic analysis. Poisson process modeling is commonly employed:

```
P(N(t) = k) = (λt)ᵏe^(-λt)/k!
```

Expected delay under stochastic conditions:
```
E[D] = ∫₀^∞ D × fD(d) dd
```

Where `fD(d)` represents the probability density function of delay.

## Multi-Objective Optimization

### Vector Optimization Formulation

Modern traffic optimization considers multiple competing objectives simultaneously:

```
minimize: f(g,C) = [f₁(g,C), f₂(g,C), ..., fm(g,C)]ᵀ
```

**Typical Objectives:**
- Vehicle delay minimization
- Fuel consumption reduction
- Emission minimization
- Pedestrian delay consideration

### Weighted Sum Approach

The scalarization method combines multiple objectives:
```
minimize: Σⱼ₌₁ᵐ wⱼ × fⱼ(g,C)
```

Subject to: `Σⱼ wⱼ = 1, wⱼ ≥ 0`
